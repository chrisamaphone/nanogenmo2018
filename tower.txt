going through sudden change
experiencing upheaval
having plans disrupted
being surprised
undergoing a crisis
having routines shaken up
being in chaos
releasing
exploding
having an emotional outburst
erupting in anger
crashing through ego defenses
breaking through pretense
letting everything go
falling down
being humbled
experiencing a crash
toppling from the heights
having a downturn in fortune
suffering a blow to the ego
having a revelation
suddenly realizing the truth
exposing what was hidden
having a burst of insight
seeing through illusions
getting the answer
seeing everything in a flash
