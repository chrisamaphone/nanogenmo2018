staying nonactive
withdrawing from involvement
allowing events to proceed without intervention
being receptive to influence
becoming calm
being passive
waiting patiently
accessing the unconscious
using your intuition
seeking guidance from within
trusting your inner voice
opening to dreams and the imagination
being aware of a larger reality
seeing the potential
understanding the possibilities
opening to what could be
seeing your hidden talents
allowing development
letting what is there flower
sensing the mystery
looking beyond the obvious
approaching a closed off area
opening to the unknown
remembering something important
sensing the secret and hidden
seeking what is concealed
acknowledging the Shadow
