closing one door to open another
bringing something to a close
completing a chapter
concluding unfinished business
putting the past behind you
having a parting of the ways
going through transition
changing status
moving from the known to the unknown
being cast adrift
waiting in an in-between state
being in the middle
eliminating excess
cutting out what isn't necessary
shedding old attitudes
getting down to bare bones
concentrating on essentials
getting back to basics
experiencing inexorable forces
being in the path of sweeping change
being caught in the inescapable
going through what cannot be avoided
being part of a powerful movement
riding your fate
accepting the inevitable
